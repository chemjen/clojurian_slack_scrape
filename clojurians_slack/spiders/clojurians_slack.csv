Sam wants to choose one or more boxes of chocolates such that the average number of chocolates in the chosen boxes is exactly equal to some integer k.  Given the number of chocolates in each box, determine the number of ways Sam can choose boxes such that the average number of chocolates across the chosen boxes is equal to k.  Since the result may be very large, return the value modulo (109+7).



For example, Alex bought 3 boxes of chocolates containing chocolate = [3, 2, 4] chocolates in the boxes. Sam wants to choose boxes such that the average number of chocolates among the chosen boxes is k = 3.  The boxes can be selected in the following 3 ways:



Take chocolate[0] having 3 chocolates.
Take chocolate[0, 1, 2] having (3, 2, 4) chocolates respectively, (3+2+4)/3 = 3
Take chocolate[1, 2] having (2, 4) chocolates respectively, (2+4)/2 = 3


Return the answer 3%(109+7) = 3.


Function Description

Complete the function chocolateBoxes in the editor below. The function should return an integer, the number of ways to choose boxes, modulo (109+7).



chocolateBoxes has the following parameter(s):

    k : an integer denoting the average number of chocolates

    chocolate[chocolate[0], chocolate[1] .... chocolate[n-1]]: an integer array where chocolate[i] denotes the number of chocolates in ith box.



Constraints

1≤ k ≤ 50
1≤ n ≤ 50
1 ≤ chocolate[i]  ≤ 50

The key is in the chaining of formula cell change notifications.

So a tree of formula cells can be used to efficiently filter changes and route interesting changes to an application.

io.aviso/rook has undergone a full rewrite, keeping its essence, but aligning with Pedestal.

Rook is a library that makes it easy to map namespaces, and functions within those namespaces, as endpoints in a Pedestal application.

You end up with far less configuration without sacrificing any of the power of Pedestal.
